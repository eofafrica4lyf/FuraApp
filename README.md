A simple app bootstrapped by create-react-app and express-starter, for Decadevs to easily order their favorite Fura Drink. Users can add orders which can be marked completed or removed only by the admin.

The app uses the React Context API to manage its state and Node with Express, MongoDB and Mongoose in the backend. 
Json Web Tokens are used for the user authorization and authentication.
